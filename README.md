# GoEmotions Text Classification

This repo contains the code for fine-tuning a RoBERTa Large language model on the GoEmotions dataset.

The notebook `train.ipynb` was used to train the model and push it to HuggingFace Hub.

Using `test.ipynb`, we can check the performance of any model available on HuggingFace.
